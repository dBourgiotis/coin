      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Dominance (D)</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed">Individuals who are a Dominance (D) style are often perceived as being direct, determined and decisive self-starters. Given their independent nature, these team members generally prefer to take charge rather than follow someone else's instructions. They are highly driven when carrying out a task and have a preference for dynamic and challenging activities with measurable results. They usually thrive when set an ambitious goal, preferring action over analysis. These team members tend to be competitive, which may be attributed to a desire for accomplishment, recognition and authority. They lean towards being highly assertive and direct, especially when pushing for their ideas. Usually they have a clear picture of how they will achieve their goals; they know what they want, and how to get it. They sometimes come across as forceful and dismissive of alternative opinions, especially those that are not in line with their plans. As action is a priority for those with this style, a strength is that they can make quick, confident and impulsive decisions. They usually appear self-assured, goaloriented and focused, which may instil a sense of confidence in others. When they state their opinion or ask a question, they mean business.</p>

    <div class="bg-gray-800/50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Influence (I)</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed">Individuals who are an Influence (I) style are generally considered outgoing, energetic, sociable and enthusiastic. Usually they are overflowing with optimism, they are vivacious and enjoy having fun at work. They are good at engaging with others and are warm, confident communicators who are capable of inspiring and persuading those around them. Being quite expressive, they really appreciate it when people pay attention and listen to them. They are often motivated by praise, social recognition and acceptance, so sometimes their fear of rejection can result in a greater focus upon popularity than in delivering concrete results. While their enthusiasm enables them to face difficult challenges head-on, being unrealistically optimistic can sometimes lead them to being impulsive when dealing with complex situations. Under pressure, they can become disorganised, lose focus and make subjective decisions. Nevertheless, their social and accepting nature can be their defining asset; they usually make a positive impact, having a sincere interest in the feelings of others. Many of their strengths lie in their effortless ability to connect with people.</p>

    <div class="bg-gray-800/50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Steadiness (S)</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed">Individuals who are a Steadiness (S) style usually come across as being calm, patient, tolerant and easy-going. They are naturally warm people who enjoy similarly supportive, consistent and loyal traits in their relationships, placing great value on stability and harmony. They are usually reliable, trustworthy and amenable towards authority. They are loyal team players, always looking out for others and supporting their ideas, even if they differ from their own. They may be uncomfortable with unexpected and abrupt change. If change is inevitable however, they will work to understand the rationale and adapt, although it might be a more gradual process. As a result of their desire to assist others, they can find it difficult to say no and may even conform to avoid conflict. Much of their strength lies in their genuine, encouraging demeanour and they are known for being sympathetic to others' perspectives, as well as having strong, active listening skills.</p>

    <div class="bg-gray-800/50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-4">Compliance (C)</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed">Individuals with the Compliance (C) style usually come across as being analytical, unemotional, calm and reserved; generally gravitating towards process, structure and rules. They are conscientious when dealing with tasks and are often perfectionists. Typically, they will spend a considerable amount of time analysing data before arriving at a decision. They are drawn towards tasks requiring logic and accuracy, and like to work independently. Relying on facts, any emotional decision or gut-feeling response is always questionable to them. They prefer to be autonomous and self-reliant, as they believe they can be more productive working independently. They do have the propensity to set unrealistic expectations and high standards for themselves and others, coming across as overly critical when under pressure. They are however reliably strong and consistent in their focus on high-quality output in any task they undertake; their work can always be relied upon to be accurate and complete.</p>
